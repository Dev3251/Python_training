tuples can store multiple items in a single variable and can be declared using parentheses

The primary difference between tuples and lists is that tuples are immutable as opposed to 
lists which are mutable. Therefore, it is possible to change a list but not a tuple. The 
contents of a tuple cannot change once they have been created in Python due to the 
immutability of tuples.
